This is not necessarily directly physical, especially for a fast optical

make the simulation quasistatic (which can help avoid undesired isometries
for example), though it may not be necessary.

such that for Wb below some scale (i.e. for suitably low curvatures), the
bend energy density used is Wb to a very good approx. If Wb is bigger than
some scale, the bend energy density is taken to be a function of Wb, such
that it grows much more sharply with curvature. This is intended to reflect
the physical fact that curvatures on the scale of the thickness should be
much more strongly penalised than they are by Wb. Thus the energy
density scale where the behaviour transitions should be something like Wb
evaluated for a curvature of 1/thickness. We take it to be that scale,
